    refresh_RefreshEverything

    This function provides a simplified way to refresh all relevant systems within the script. 
    It currently refreshes the job management system by calling the `job_management_zzload_Init` function.
    This function can be expanded in the future to include refreshing other systems as needed.

    @return nil: This function does not return any values but triggers the refresh process for relevant systems.

    -- Potential future expansions could include:

    -- - Reloading configuration settings
    -- - Resetting cached data
